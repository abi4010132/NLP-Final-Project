2,can i replace badger   with a badger    with same connections,plumbing connections will vary with different models usually the larger higher amp draw wil not affect the wiring the disposals are designed to a basic standard setup common to all brands they want you to buy their brand or version or model as long as the disposal is ul listed united laboratories they will setup and bolt up the same
3,does this come with power cord and dishwasher hook up,it does not come with a power cord it does come with the dishwasher hookup
4,loud noise inside when turned on sounds like blades are loose,check if you dropped something insideusually my wife put lemons inside make a lot of noise and i will have to get them out using my hands or mechanical fingers 
5,where is the reset button located,on the bottom
6,i have a badger  it is leaking water at bottom near reset bottom plus does a new one came with a ss ring for inside the sink,if your garbage disposal is leaking out the bottom near the reset button you most likely have a leak in the metal plate that is located directly under the blades this plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor the rotor the shaft etc from moisture but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel after a year or two especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel which will then also start to corrode until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere could be somewhere very small signaling the end of the machines service life the plate is not meant to be repaired only replaced along with the rest of the unit that water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard and should be dealt with immediately by removing the damaged unit the manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this moreexpensive metal good luck
7,if no power cord is included how do i plug in the disposal unit,i ttok mine off of the broken unit and installed it on the new one
8,can someone tell me if this badger  disposer is simple to replace with my old broken badger  ie can i do it myself vs hiring a plumber ,i replaced my a couple of months ago i am semihandy fixing a lot of small stuff around the house i am small and in my late seventies the only problem was holding the unit up in place while turning the locking ring i no longer have the upper body strength to do it so i used a stack of books made sure all the connections were tight and have had so problems since it clean and in good shape so i left the old badger mount in the sink took about forty min but a lot of that was getting the books

13,my present disposal has a  bolt connection would changing to the twist type connection for a new disposal make installation complicated,if i understand your present disposal  bolts the twist type should be no problem when you order it is a bit confusing as to what comes with the disposal when they show people often order some things when the get the disposal you do not need any of those it all come with it the only thing you might need would be some different drain pipe but most likely you will not i hope i was some help bill

36,how many test kits are there in a box how mant times can i test the water,just once there are several types of test in the box but they are each designed to only be used once
37,how many strips come in the kit i need at least ,the kit contains one strip per test so if you want to test  water sources you could pool them a better plan might be to buy two kits and test a pool of  water sources for each that way if one set is positive you only need to buy  more for a total of  kits rather than 
38,can more than one water source be tested,no there is only one test kit for each substance you could only test two if you mixed them together and did it as a pooled sample
39,has anyone used this to test for lead do you think its accurate,we used it to test for lead and we have no reason to believe the result was inaccurate all of its other tests gave results that made me feel like the test was genuine

41,does it have a colour indicator,all the tests are based on color  for the lead test its a line indicator
42,does this kit tell you the amount of nitrates or just tell you its too high,you would need to go through a lab to get the exact amount with this kit you follow a color chart and compare to the epa standard
43,is there an expiration date on any of the tests,yes on the back side of the plastic packaging which houses the contents including the instructions and different package envelopes which contain the chemicals for the variety of tests there are no dates on the individual test envelopes that i can see but there is definitely an expiration date on the back outside of the clear plastic packaging right next to the words watersafe city water test kit i hope this is a clear explanation and that it helps
44,does it test coliform e coli ,it has a test for bacteria for example ecoli however the bacteria test does not specify what kind you have in there
45,does this test forlead,yes it does
46,filter for vicks,filter for vicks is not a question what are you asking
47,i have not purchased the humidifier that uses this filter yet but on average how long does this filter last a rough estimate,the outer she will will fall apart in about a year of use but the filter itself can survive much longer mine split at the seam so its no longer round but it still fits in the humidifier and does its job cleaning the filter every week especially if you have hard water will degrade the material over time i have used one in this manner for  years so far
48,i need to replace a holmes wick hwft does this filter fit,the only humidifiers that this will fit are sunbeam scm scm and scm and holmes hm and hm according to the filter box so i think the answer to your question is no sorry

51,is this model for the  holmes humidifier,its for the hwf i see other vendors do have the filter with the black mesh like the picture shows
52,does this filter fit the holmes hm,all i know is that i have an older model of the holmes room humidifier it does not have any code on it anyway the filter was too tall but it did fit so i cut it in half very hard to do with chic hands but i did it and now i have  filters for the price of one other than all that i am happy wit
53,what is the size ,works with holmes and sunbeam humidifier model s hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm scm scm scm scm scm scm package quantity  filter size xx features antimicrobial protection compatible with holmes  sunbeam humidifiers
54,the filters i received did not have the black on the outside what is the black for,i am not an expert let me start to answer your question with a question is there an outer core in any other color that is made of a different material than the inner core the inner core white in the picture is softer to the touch the outer core i suspect is what helps it stand up i do not think the color matters the outer core feels like plastic the inner core is definitely not plastic i suspect the color does not matter if this does not completely answer your question ask away i enjoy doing this
55,does it fit hm i see someone left same question but i do not see answer,i just googled it and it says this filter works for it
56,does it work with kenmore humidifier,yes it does
57,do i need to tear off the black outside before i put the new filter into the machine,no that is part of the filter and provides support
58,does this filter fit the holmes hm,yes
59,anyone have issues with the filter rotting or smelling really bad after a few weeks of use,do not have an issue with the filter rotting or smelling bad after usage if you do not plan on using it much the water container should be emptied and the filter dried out

91,how many loads can you wash before it needs emptied,i would check it after every dryer run the water evaporates quickly
92,does it have screens in place where the vents are to prevent lint from blowing out of the vent holes,no the way it works is that the tray is about half full of water there is a line you fill it up to the air hits the water and that catches most of the lint it is not  effective  a little still flies out but it is a good bit more effective than you would think it would be i think it basically gets the lint wet enough that it is too heavy to escape remember this is only catching the lint that the lint screen inside the dryer missed  it is not anything like the amount per load you pull out of the dryer lint screen

94,will the ltf lint dryer kit work on a gas dryer,i believe there is a disclaimer on these units that they should not be used on gas dryers gas dryers really need to be vented outdoors because unlike electric dryers there is combustion and that results in fumes the other vent shown with this one dundas jafine tdidvkzw proflex indoor dryer vent kit states in the description not be used with gas clothes dryers i would not do it
